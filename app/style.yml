# When styling a canon profile, the first thing you should do is heavily customize these variables.
# Each of the following variables is used throughout both the admin panel and generated profile css.
# If you replace the default grayscale colors, you should try and use similar shades.

# It is recommended that you also use these variables in your css files. i.e., `color: var(--accent);`
# They can also be imported and used by react components: `import styles from style.yml`, then `<span style={{color: styles["alert-dark"]}} />`
# And of course, you can add as many new variables here as you like, and use them in the same way.

# The pigments plugin is highly recommended for visualizing hex values as colors in your text editor:

# GOTCHAS:
# 1. When aliasing variables in this file (i.e., `section-text-color: "var(--dark-2)"`), these variables will be replaced in css files, but NOT in js files.
# 2. Currently, after making changes to this file, you will need to clear the cache `rm -rf node_modules/.cache` and then rerun the build. There's an issue for this.
# 3. Make sure there are no more than 1 empty line at the end of the file, or style.yml will not be recognized and your build will fail. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Finally, if you encounter any bugs, are confused by anything, or wish things were better/different, let @perpetualgrimace know!
